### üåç Environmental Statistics Project ‚Äì Spatial Analysis of Temperature Data  

Conducted a comprehensive spatial analysis to model and interpret temperature variations across a defined region using geostatistical techniques in R.

-  Performed exploratory data analysis including descriptive statistics, boxplots, histograms, and 3D scatter plots to detect patterns and outliers.
-  Applied spatial interpolation methods:
  - **Trend Surface Modeling** to assess large-scale spatial trends.
  - **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)** for deterministic prediction.
  - **Ordinary Kriging** with variogram modeling (spherical, exponential, Gaussian) to account for spatial autocorrelation.
-  Built and evaluated empirical and theoretical variograms, including nugget, sill, and range estimation.
-  Validated model performance through cross-validation, prediction error visualization, and comparative accuracy assessment.
-  Assessed spatial dependency and clustering patterns using **Moran‚Äôs I** and **Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA)**.
-  Visualized spatial temperature predictions and residuals through thematic mapping using `sp`, `gstat`, and `tmap` packages.
